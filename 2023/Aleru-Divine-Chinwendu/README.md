## Introduction

Hello everyone, I’m Aleru Divine Chinwendu and I’m from Nigeria. I am a software developer, technical writer, and love to read. I am mostly passionate about new technology and simplifying life and I love staying up-to-date with the latest trends and advancements in the tech industry.

I've always been intrigued by the power of effective content management systems, and Wagtail, with its polished administration interface built upon the Django web framework, stands out in this domain.
The idea of introducing documentation directly within the CMS, like an "onboarding tour guide" or "More info" pop-ups, is something I find innovative and user-centric. I'm also keen on exploring the potential of video content for documentation, as I believe multimedia can significantly enhance user understanding and engagement.

My interest in joining Outreachy with Wagtail stems from a blend of my passion for open-source contributions, my alignment with Wagtail's goals, and the opportunity to make a tangible impact in the realm of CMS accessibility and documentation.

I look forward to connecting with everyone here, from the mentors to fellow contributors, and embarking on this transformative journey together.
